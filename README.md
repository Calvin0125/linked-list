# linked-list
This is my first implementation of a linked list in Ruby. I was able to add a few basic array-like functions and overwrote the to_s 
method so 'puts' will give a visual representation of the list. Although arrays are generally the better choice, this was a first
step in understanding how to implement and manipulate my own data structures.
